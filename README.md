# insta360

I have made this instagram lookalike app, but the difference is that post content is of 360° panoramic image and 360° video view.

I have tried to implement all features but completed features are:
- Log In
- Sign Up (registration)
- Add posts
- Like and comment posts
- Send and receive follow requests
- Chat


Following are the features which are incomplete which has to be done:
- Explore screen and search
- VR view
- Circular progress bar for asynchronous events
- Send post in chat
- save post

I have used Google's firestore firebase for backend, as cloud functions comes under the paid plan so I used firebase only for data storage and all the processing of data are done in flutter side code.

Following are screen recordings of the app:
